# Orrery execution tracker

**Reconstructed 2026-09-28** after the workspace moved WSL → Fedora (`/home/zero` is a symlink to
`/home/day`; all paths still resolve). The previous `.tmp/TRACKER.md` did not survive the move.
This file is rebuilt from git history, the plans, and the live repository — **not** from memory of
the old file, so anything it cannot evidence is marked UNKNOWN rather than guessed.

## How to read this

- Every phase has a status: **DONE**, **IN PROGRESS**, or **NOT STARTED**. Nothing is "mostly done".
- A task is DONE only if its code is committed **and** the evidence line lists a passing command.
- The `UNKNOWN` marker means the evidence needed to decide was lost with the old tracker. Those
  items are listed so they get re-checked, not so they can be quietly treated as done.

## Environment (new host, re-established 2026-09-28)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| OS | Fedora 44, kernel 6.19.10-300.fc44 |
| Node | 24.21.0 (the old host was 24.13.1, which was **below** Zod 4.4.3's `^24.15.0`; this host satisfies it) |
| pnpm | 10.0.0 (corepack) |
| Container runtime | rootless **podman 5.8.7**, with `systemctl --user start podman.socket` exposing the Docker API at `unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock` |
| Postgres | 16-alpine, container `orrery-pg`, published on **55432** (matches `.env.test`) |
| Extensions | citext, pg_trgm, btree_gin, pg_stat_statements (from `infra/postgres/init/01-extensions.sql`) |

Three things had to be re-established, and each is a portability finding worth keeping:

1. **`docker.sock` is not usable by this account.** The socket is `root:docker` mode `0660` and the
   user is in `wheel`, not `docker`; `sudo` needs a password. The Docker CLI works by pointing
   `DOCKER_HOST` at the rootless podman socket. **Every command that needs Docker must export it.**
2. **`docker compose` cannot bind the `infra/postgres/init` volume.** Fedora has SELinux enforcing
   and podman refuses a bind mount without a `:z` relabel. Rather than mutate `docker-compose.yml`
   for one host's policy, Postgres is run directly with `podman run` and the init SQL is applied
   with `docker cp` + `psql`. The compose file is therefore **untested on this host** — flagged
   below, because that is a real gap in what "the stack starts" means.
3. **`*.tsbuildinfo` survived the move but `dist/` did not.** `tsc -b` then believed every package
   was up to date and the workspace failed to resolve `@orrery/clock`. Fixed by deleting the
   `tsbuildinfo` files. This is a class of failure that will recur on any host move or partial
   checkout, and the first symptom is a bogus "cannot find module" for a package that exists.

## Current verified state

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Commits | 48 (P3-T5 landed after this file was written; see the table) |
| Unit tests | **915** (clock 29, ids 10, rng 16, config 48, auth 384, i18n 25, db 8, contracts 251, web 139, worker 5) |
| Integration tests | **152** across 11 files, real Postgres |
| Gates | **8 / 8 passing** |
| Lint / typecheck | 0 / 0 errors |
| Invariants registered | 29 (8 active) |
| Web production build | succeeds; `app-build-manifest.json` present, so the bundle gate is real |

The bundle budget gate is only meaningful because `apps/web` was built on this host. A gate that
reports "no manifest — cannot measure" is a gate that is not running, and it says so.

## Phase status

### P0 — Foundation & decisions · **DONE** (24h est.)

Commits `e1e387f` … `09eb3c6`. Schema gate written as the root-cause fix for review finding B1 (a
Prisma schema that shipped in the plan set had ten validation errors and nothing ever ran
`prisma validate`). Next.js app with an isolated exam surface; bundle budget gate made real; a
Dockerfile that **runs the gates at build time**; logging with scrubbed fields and the `attemptId`
spine; worker; provisioning ledger; CSP nonce; ADRs 0025–0030 reconciling the plan against what
P0 actually built.

### P1 — Identity, sessions & the `can()` kernel · **DONE** (28h est.)

Commits `9245ebd` … `43399a2`. The `can()` kernel as data with 100% branch coverage; session
kernel with epoch invalidation; timezone-aware deadlines; argon2id with school-safe throttling and
the Better Auth seam; account lifecycle as a pure state machine plus the `SecurityEvent` it
revealed was missing; auth UI with account enumeration closed at three layers; sessions page
proving the P1-T4 done-when end to end; account deletion with the tombstone the schema forced;
classroom-scoped matrix types after the bug where membership granted authority; TOTP with replay
protection (two P1 invariants flipped active); impersonation as a read-only gate that runs
**before** authorisation.

### P2 — Content model, block schema & editor · **DONE** (64h est.)

Commits `187fa19` … `82a3ae8`.

- 16-type closed block union, and why `.strict()` is not enough. Block migration with a fixture
  corpus and the seventh gate.
- The block renderer: 16 types, axe clean, XSS corpus swept.
- Lifecycle, visibility, and the read-time re-check. Read path against a real row, with a cache
  that holds no permissions.
- `validateForPublish`: a checklist with fixes, not a wall of red.
- The P2-T3 risk spike — **the kill-switch did not fire.** Three blockers found, two resolved, one
  excluded by the trigger wording, and no 2× estimate consumed. P2-T11 remains unbuilt insurance.
- Autosave and the three-way conflict panel; atomic node attrs and the block handle (both
  remaining blockers resolved).
- Write-once versioning, structural diff, restore. **INV-CONTENT-1 active.** A duplicate is a new
  resource, not a new version, because INV-CONTENT-1 makes a second identical version a
  multi-valued answer that quietly breaks every pinning assignment.
- Media library, transactional quotas, the publish-time blocks cap.
- The resource library: blast radius, transfer, duplicate.
- The slash palette and four atomic node views; editor/renderer accessibility — computed contrast,
  a real key map.

### P3 — Subjects, library, search & moderation · **IN PROGRESS** (30h est.)

| Task | Status | Commit | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| P3-T1 subject hierarchy, tag merge, classification | **DONE** | `a8bd3b5` | Cycle-safe `moveSubject` under advisory lock; conflict-safe tag merge across `ResourceTag` and `QuestionTag`; real-Postgres concurrency tests prove at most one conflicting move succeeds. |
| P3-T2 subject seed | **DONE** | `4750a3c` | 246 subjects (plan said "~120" — recorded, and the gate asserts a *range*). **The gate found nine subjects that were their own parent**, plus nine roots sharing `position: 0`. |
| P3-T3 public library | **DONE** | `89d9c10` | No anonymous `Actor` by design. `plans/05` §6's **under-18 rule** enforced in SQL. Keyset paging. Four distinguishable empty states. |
| P3-T4 search, facets, zero-result log | **DONE** | `11e73ed` | Weighted `tsvector` as a generated column. Also **implemented schema-gate check 2**, which had been documented since P0-T4 and never written. |
| P3-T5 ratings, comments, flagging, takedown SLA | **DONE** | *(this commit)* | Vocabulary, schema, migration, auth rules, moderation service, 29 integration tests. The SLA is a **gate**, not a number in a column. |
| P3-T6 slugs, canonical URLs, OG images, sitemap | NOT STARTED | — | |

#### P3-T5 detail (complete)

Done and verified:

- **Four new actions** in the closed vocabulary: `rate`, `comment`, `flag`, `moderate`. `moderate`
  is the one genuinely new in kind: every other verb acts on content the actor is party to, and
  this one acts on a third party's content on the strength of a role alone.
- **Three new types** (`Rating`, `Comment`, `Flag`) added to `ALL_RESOURCE_TYPES` and
  `IMPLEMENTED_TYPES` together, because a rule that reads a rating without checking it belongs to
  the same reader is only wrong *in combination*.
- **Totality test evidence, before and after.** Declaring the types with no rules produced six
  `TS2739`/`TS1360` errors naming all four actions and all three types — the "prove the test fails
  first" evidence P1-T6 requires. After writing the rules: `tsc` clean, 384 auth tests passing.
- **Migration `0008_moderation`** with five `CHECK` constraints the schema language cannot
  express, each replacing a place where the application was the only thing holding a line:
  `Rating.value BETWEEN 1 AND 5`; a `HIDDEN`/`REMOVED` comment must carry a reason; a
  `PENDING_REVIEW` comment must carry `gatedAt` + `gateReason`; a resolved flag must carry a
  resolution; `reason = 'OTHER'` must carry detail; and `dueAt >= createdAt`.
- `Comment.status` changed from a bare `String @default("VISIBLE")` to a real `CommentStatus`
  enum. The old column let a typo become a row no query matched and no query rejected.
- Named relations, because a `User` is now on the other side of moderation in three distinct
  capacities — author, moderator, resolver — and three unnamed `User?` fields cannot be told
  apart in a query or in a mistake.
- `totality-d14.test.ts` now **derives** the cell count as `IMPLEMENTED_TYPES.length ×
  ACTIONS.length` instead of hardcoding `138`. The old literal had to be renumbered twice by
  hand, which is how a pinned number becomes a test that means nothing.

Decisions taken that a reviewer should look at:

- **A takedown is not a type.** It is the resolution of a `Flag` and lands on the thing itself
  (`Resource.status = WITHDRAWN` from P2-T8, or `Comment.status = HIDDEN`). A `Takedown` type
  would have been a second place to record "this content is down" and therefore a second thing to
  get out of step.
- **A `Flag` always has a `resourceId`**, and a `commentId` is optional and means "this comment on
  that resource". Two nullable polymorphic FKs would have needed a `CHECK` to stop the "neither"
  and "both" states; this way "both" is the only reachable option and it is the correct one.
- **The SLA tiers are a judgement, not a plan value.** `plans/05` §6 says "a documented takedown
  SLA" and gives no number, and no other plan gives one either. The tiers and their justification
  are written in the service header; they need a human decision before GA and this records that.
- **Comment gating is both-sided**: a comment *by* a minor is held, and so is a comment *on* a
  minor's resource. `plans/05` says "comments (moderation-gated for minors)" without saying
  which. The author-side is the stronger argument, since the public surface is where a stranger
  would target a child.

The service and its tests, landed in the same commit:

- `rateResource` is an **upsert**, not an insert. A unique `(resourceId, userId)` plus an
  INSERT makes the star widget single-use, so a visitor who changes their mind has to create a
  second account. `ratingSummary` returns all five buckets *including the zeroes* and a null
  mean when empty, because a UI needs five buckets to render five stars and "4.2" beside
  "2 ratings" is the case the count exists to explain.
- `postComment` gates on **both** ends: a comment *by* a minor is held, and so is a comment *on* a
  minor's resource. `plans/05` says "moderation-gated for minors" without saying which. The
  second is the stronger claim and the one that costs product; it is worth it because those
  resources are not publicly listed by default (P3-T3), so anything reachable is reachable
  through a deliberate share.
- `moderationQueue` is ordered by **deadline, not age**. Sorted by age, a week-old `COPYRIGHT`
  flag sits above a `SAFEGUARDING` flag raised an hour ago and the urgent thing is at the bottom.
  `overdueMs` is clamped at zero: reporting a negative lateness for "three hours early" makes a
  sum over the queue wrong in a way that averages to nothing and totals to something absurd.
- `resolveFlag` **refuses an overdue flag with 409** until the caller passes
  `acknowledgeOverdue`, which stamps `acknowledgedOverdueAt` on the row and puts `wasOverdue`
  and `overdueHours` in the audit event. A queue that merely *records* a deadline is a reporting
  feature, and reporting features are not read.
- A duplicate report is a **success**, not an error, and does not reset the running clock —
  otherwise a report could be kept alive forever by re-submitting it.
- Every deadline is computed from a `FrozenClock` in the tests. A queue whose deadline can only
  be tested by waiting an hour is a queue whose deadline is never tested.

**The bug the tests caught:** `withdraw: true` on a *comment* flag withdrew the whole resource,
so one moderated sentence removed a teacher's published lesson. The two easy fixes are both
wrong — silently ignoring the request would leave the moderator believing they took it down, and
honouring it is the bug. It is now **refused with 409** and the message says withdrawing a
resource is a separate door with a separate decision.

**The SLA tiers are a judgement, not a plan value.** No plan gives a number. `SAFEGUARDING` 1h,
`UNSAFE_OR_HARMFUL` and `PERSONAL_INFORMATION` 24h, `OFFENSIVE`/`MISINFORMATION` 72h,
`COPYRIGHT`/`SPAM`/`OTHER` 7 days. PII is deliberately on the same clock as unsafe content: a
child's name on a public resource is harmful on the same timescale, and a slower PII clock would
rank it as less urgent than a rude word. **These need a human decision before GA** — the file
is the documentation `plans/05` asks for, and the numbers are the part to argue with.

### P4 … P17 — **NOT STARTED**

P4 classrooms/membership/invites · P5 assignments/pinning/banks/blueprints · P6 simulation platform
and the 24 gold sims · P7 quiz runtime and auto-grading · P8 exam runtime and integrity · P9 teacher
review and grading · P10 atomic release and results · P11 item analysis and gradebook · P12
simulation scale-out to 220 · P13 accessibility and i18n · P14 security, privacy, compliance ·
P15 reliability, performance, DR · P16 interop (QTI/xAPI/LTI/OneRoster) · P17 pilot and GA.

## Carried-forward gaps (recorded before the move, re-confirmed where possible)

- **`readImpersonation()` returns `null`** because signed-cookie verification is not wired. It
  fails closed, so it is a missing feature rather than an open hole.
- **Register → verify integration seeds rows** rather than exercising the full Better Auth email
  flow.
- **P2-T7 2.4.11 occlusion and P2-T3b 500-block paint performance** need a real browser. jsdom
  proves the mechanisms, not the rendering.
- **`docker-compose.yml` is unverified on this host** (SELinux). The Postgres it declares works
  when run directly; the compose path does not. This should be fixed in the compose file with a
  `:z` relabel so `docker compose up` is portable to SELinux hosts, and that is a real task.
- **P2-T11 remains unbuilt insurance.** The P2-T3 kill-switch never fired.

## Evidence commands

Run from the repo root, with `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock` exported and
the `orrery-pg` container running.

```
pnpm run build          # must pass before typecheck; tsbuildinfo can go stale
pnpm run typecheck      # 0 errors
pnpm run lint           # 0 errors
pnpm run gates          # 8 / 8
pnpm run test           # 915 unit
pnpm run test:integration   # 152 across 11 files, needs DATABASE_URL
cd apps/web && pnpm run build   # produces app-build-manifest.json for the bundle gate
```

Integration tests need `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://orrery:orrery@localhost:55432/orrery`. The
database is **shared across runs with no cleanup**, so every test uses a per-run UUID-derived
slug or token; and a test count that has not moved is not evidence.
